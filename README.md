# LSP Server Template

My intention with this project is to have a simple template with all basic
protocol needs implemented to make it easier to create new LSP servers.

## Steps to use this as a base repo

1. Rename `/cmd/rename_server` directory to the name of your LSP server;
2. If you want to make a simpler server, or if the language doesn't support
all messages / methods, you may delete the unnecessary messages and types.
